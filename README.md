# JaCo_GUI
JaCo is a standalone desktop application based on Java and JavaFX, which will monitor and display real-time COVID-19 data. 
JaCo does not pick up data from every new source, but rather it relies on some valuable and trustworthy resources
like Johns Hopkins University's GitHub database etc.
